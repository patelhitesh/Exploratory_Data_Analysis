# Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects using datasets from sources like Kaggle. Each analysis demonstrates the process of cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting data to uncover meaningful insights.

The goal is to showcase practical data analysis in Python, including:
- Handling missing values and data quality checks
- Summarizing distributions and categorical features
- Visualizing trends and relationships
- Highlighting key insights and potential next steps for modeling

## Datasets Included

- Dataset 1: [Diabetes Dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset))

(This list will expand as more EDA projects are added.)
